Let us generalize the proposed question.  Let $P_{n}$ denote the
number of ways of paying the amount of $n$ cents with five kinds of
coins: cents, nickels, dimes, quarters and half-dollars.  The "way of
paying" is determined if, and only if, it is known how many coins of
each kind are used.  Thus, $P_{4}=1, P_{5}=2, P_{10} = 4$.  It is
appropriate to set $P_{0}=1$.  The problem stated at the outset
requires us to compute $P_{100}$.  More generally, we wish to
understand the nature of $P_{n}$ and eventually devise a procedure
for computing $P_{n}$.

It may help to visiualize the various possibilities.  We may use no
cent, or just 1 cent, or 2 cents, or 3 cents, or ... .  These
alternatives are schematically pictured in the first line of Figure 1;
[fn::A photo of actual coins would be more efffective here but too
clumsy in the following figures.] "no cent" is represened by a square
which may remind us of an empty desk.  The second line pictures the
alternatives: using no nickel, 1 nickel, 2 nickels, ... The following
three lines represent in the same way the possibilities regarding
dimes, quarters and half-dollars.  We have to choose one picture from
the first line, then one picture from the second line and so on,
choosing just one picture from each line; combining (juxtaposing) the
five pictures so selected, we obtain a manner of paying.  Thus, Figure
1 exhibits directly the alternatives regarding each kind of coin and,
indirectly, all manners of paying we are concerned with.

The main discovery consists in observing that, in fact we combine the
picutres in Figure 1 according to certain rules in algebra: if we
conceive each line of Figure 1 as the /sum/ of pictures contained in
it and we consider the /product/ of these five (infinite) sums, in
short, if we pass from Figure 1 to Figure 2, and we develop the
product, the terms of this development will represent the various
manners of paying we are concerned with.  The one term of the product
exhibited in the last line of Figure 2 as an example represents one
manner of paying one dollar (putting down no cents, three nickels, one
dime, one quarter and one half-dollar).  The sum of all such terms is
an infinite series of pictures; each picture exhibits one manner of
paying, different terms represent different manners of paying, and the
whole series of pictures, appropriately called the /figurate series/,
displays all manners of paying that we have have to consider when we
wish to compute the numbers $P_{n}$.

Yet this way of conceiving Figure 2 raises various difficulties.
First, there is a theoretical difficulty: in which sense can we add
and multiply pictures?  Then, there is a practical difficulty: how can
we pick out conveniently from the whole figurate series the terms
counted by $P_{n}$, that is, those cases in which the sum paid amounts
to just $n$ cents?

We avoid the theoretical difficulty if we employ the pictures, these
symbols of a primitive writing, as we are used to employing the
letters of more civilized alphabets: we regard each picture as the
symbol for a variable or /indeterminate/.
[fn::In a formal presentation it may be advisable to restrict
the term "picture" to denote a (visible, written or printed) symbol
that stands for an indeterminate; in the present introductory, rather
informal, address the word is now and then loosely used.
\par
Let us pass over two somewhat touchy points: the infinity of variables
and the convergence of the series in which they arise.  Both are
considered in certain advanced theories and both are momentary.  They
will be eliminated by the next step.]

To master the other difficulty, we need one more essential idea: we
substitute for each "pictoral" variable (that is, variable represented
by a picture) a power of a new variable $x$, the /exponent/ of which
is the /joint value of the coins/ represented by the picture, as it is
shown in detail by Figure 3.  The third line of Figure 3 shows a lucky
coincidence: we have conceived the three juxtaposed nickels as /one
picture/, as the symbol of one variable (corresponding to the use of
pecisely three nickels).  For this variable we have to substitute
$x^{15}$ according to our general rule; yet even if we substitute for
each of the juxtaposed coins the correct power of $x$ and consider the
product of these juxtaposed powers. we arrive at the same final result
$x^{15}$.

The last line of Figure 3 is very important.  It show by an example
(see the last line of Fig. 2) how the described substitution affects
the general term of the figurate series.  Such a term is the product
of 5 pictures (pictoral variables).  For each factor a power of $x$ is
substituted whose exponent is the value in cents of that factor; the
exponent of the product obtained as a sum of 5 exponents, will be the
joint value of the factor.  And so the substitution indicated by
Figure 3 changes each term of the figurate series into a power
$x^{n}$.  As the figurate series represents each manner of paying just
once, the exponent $n$ arises precisely $P_{n}$ times so that (after
suitable rearrangement of the terms) the whole figurate series goes
into

\begin{equation}
P_{0} + P_{1}x + P_{2}x^{2} + ... + P_{n}x^{n} + ... .\tag{1}
\end{equation}

In this series the coefficient $x^{n}$ enumerates the different
manners of paying the amount of $n$ cents, and so (1) is suitably
called the /enumerating series/.

The substitution indicated by Figure 3 changes the first line of
Figure 2 into a geometric series:

\begin{equation}
1 + x + x^{2} + x^{3} + ... = (1 - x)^{-1}.\tag{2}
\end{equation}

In fact, this substitution changes each of the first five lines of
Figure 2 into some geometric series and the equation indicated by
Figure 2 goes over into

\begin{equation}
(1 - x)^{-1}(1 - x^{5})^{-1}(1 - x^{10})^{-1}(1 - x^{25})^{-1}(1 -
x^{50})^{-1} = P_{0} + P_{1}x + P_{2}x^{2} + ... + P_{n}x^{n} +
... .\tag{3}
\end{equation}

We have succeeded in expressiong the sum of the enumerating series.
This sum is ususally termed the /generating function/; in fact, this
function, expanded in powers of $x$, generates the numbers \(P_{0},
P_{1}, ..., P_{n}, ...\) , the combinatorial meaning of which was our
starting point.

We have reduced a combinatorial problem to a problem of a different
kind: expanding a given function of $x$ in powers of $x$.  In
particular, we have reduced our initial problem about changing a
dollar to the problem of computing the coefficient of $x^{100}$ in the
expansion of the left hand side of (3).  Our main goal was to show how
picture-writing can be used for this reduction.  Yet let us add a
brief indication about the numerical computation.

The left hand side of (3) is a product of five factors.  The well
known expansion of the first factor is shown by (2).  We proceed by
adjoining successive factors, one at a time.  Assume, for example,
that we have already obtained the expansion of the product of the
first two factors:

\begin{equation*}
(1 - x)^{-1}(1 - x^{5})^{-1} = a_{0} + a_{1}x + a_{2}x^{2} + ... ,
\end{equation*}

and we wish to go on hence to threee factors:

\begin{equation*}
(1 - x)^{-1}(1 - x^{5})^{-1}(1 - x^{10})^{-1} = b_{0} + b_{1}x +
b_{2}x^{2} + ... .
\end{equation*}

It follows that

\begin{equation*}
(b_{0} + b_{1}x + b_{2}x^{2} + ...)(1 - x^{10}) = a_{0} + a_{1}x +
a_{2}x^{2} + ... .
\end{equation*}

Comparing the coefficient of $x^{n}$ on both sides, we find that

\begin{equation}
b_{n} = b_{n - 10} + a_{n}\tag{4}
\end{equation}

(set $b_{m} = 0$ if $m < 0$). By (4), we can conveniently compute the
coefficients $b_{n}$ by recursion if the $a_{n}$ are already known, and
the series (3) can be obtained from (2) in four successive steps each
of which is similar to the one we have just discussed.

We add a table that shows the computation of $P_{50}$.  This table
exhibits the coefficient of $x^n$ for some values of $n$ in five
different expansions.  The head of each column shows the value of $n$,
the beginning of each row the last factor taken into account; the
bottom row would show $P_{n}$ for $n = 0, 5, 10, ..., 50$ /if/ we had
computed it.  Yet the table registers only the steps needed for
computing the answer to our initial question and yields $P_{50} = 50$;
that is, one can pay 50 cents in exactly 50 different ways.  We leave
it to the reader to continue the computation and verify that $P_{100}
= 292$; he can also try to justify the procedure of computation
directly without resorting to the enumerating series.[fn::For the
usual method of deriving the generating function, /cf/. 1.Vol. 1, p.1,
